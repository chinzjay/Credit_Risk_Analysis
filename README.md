# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate credit card risk models using resampling and to identify whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
## Results
Using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, three machine learning models: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE algorithms and undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithms were evaluated to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. For each resampling algorithm, the following were performed:
- LogisticRegression classifier was used to make predictions and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
- Accuracy score of the model was calculated.
- Confusion matrix was generated.
- Imbalanced classification report was printed.
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results
## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning
